            <p>Q1 earnings comment:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Moving central DPS forecast to 4.75 from EUR5.00 to EUR4.75, dividend risk increasing after weak Q1 results (weakness also seen in peers).</li>
            <li>At EUR4.88, the z5 currently still trades relatively strong in my view. I would expect the recent upward trend to reverse. Given my forecast and the growing downside risks, we would need to see a price of EUR4.25-4.50 for the z5 to be interesting again. No need to get involved here on the long side</li>
            <li>Net income weak at -34%; risk to FY earnings guidance rising. Company still pointing to 5-15% EBIT decline at FY24; that may see downward revision. Consensus however already at -17%, hence some more weakness already priced in.</li>
            </ul>
